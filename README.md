# Implemented Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
This project showcases my custom implementations of popular Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. Each component is written from scratch to deepen my understanding of core concepts and improve my problem-solving skills. The repository includes documented code for structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and algorithms such as sorting and searching. It is designed as a learning resource and a demonstration of **my proficiency in Java, algorithmic thinking, and foundational computer science principles**.

Plus, I write unit tests for each DSA I implement to make sure all DSAs work correctly every time I update this repository.

- [Merge Sort](app/src/main/java/mahmh/customdsa/arrays/MergeSort.java)

### Graphs
- [Dijkstra's Algorithm](app/src/main/java/mahmh/customdsa/graphs/Dijkstra.java)
- [Depth First Search (DFS)](app/src/main/java/mahmh/customdsa/graphs/DepthFirstSearch.java)
- [Breadth First Search (BFS)](app/src/main/java/mahmh/customdsa/graphs/BreadthFirstSearch.java)
